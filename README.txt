This is a little screenshot taking program. It only works on windows, and has been developed in Lazarus.

By default, you press Ctrl+Alt+C to start taking a screenshot and select the required area holding LMB.

The last key of the combination described above can be changed by clicking on the little scissors tray icon with RMB and selecting 'Change shortcut'.
After that, you will be prompted to push any button, which will then be used as the last part of the combination to take a screenshot.
